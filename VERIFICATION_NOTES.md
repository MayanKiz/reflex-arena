# Browser verification notes

- The Next.js entry screen renders the new Color Rush shell with the deep-space background, editorial typography, warm gold/lilac accents, and responsive glass card.
- Continuing to the rules screen shows a compact leaderboard preview with only the top-player slot; the full rankings are not shown initially.
- The `View all` control opens a separate `GLOBAL RANKINGS` screen. With no hosted/local scores it shows an intentional empty state and a `LOCAL CACHE` status.
- The setup screen accepts a 2–15 character name and preserves the existing challenge settings copy.
- The first challenge shows the quick guide modal with the visual guide asset, then a full-screen countdown overlay before gameplay.
- Browser smoke test reached the live arena HUD with target lockup, timer, score, streak, 5×5 orb board, pause control, back control, and end-round action visible.
- Production build passed with Next.js App Router routes for `/`, `/api/leaderboard`, `/api/submit-score`, `/api/database-health`, and `/api/telegram-health`.

The live arena smoke test also confirmed the timer counts down, the target label and swatch render, a correct matching orb awards +5 and advances the round, the board regenerates, and the streak/feedback copy updates.

After the sample round completed, the result screen displayed final score, hits, accuracy, best score, and a single compact leaderboard row for the top player. The local fallback board populated correctly even without Neon configuration, and the dedicated `View all` action remained available.

The populated full leaderboard rendered the top player as a clean ranked row, and clicking that row opened the player profile with top score, total games, average accuracy, and run history. This confirms the separate leaderboard screen is not just a visual placeholder.

Refinement smoke test: the landing card is visibly wider and shorter, the copy is reduced, body scrolling is removed in favor of the contained app stage, and the rules view keeps a compact one-player leaderboard area.

Second refinement smoke test: submitting a player name now opens a `ROUND READY` lobby with a clear `START ROUND` CTA and no active board. Only pressing that CTA triggers the countdown; the game board is not playable before the action.

Component refactor verification: the entry, rules, setup, round-ready lobby, countdown, and active game arena all render after extraction. The desktop arena now shows the player name, target color, timer, score, streak, and a compact 4×4 board together at laptop viewport size. The page orchestrator is 246 lines, while reusable screens, modals, shared UI, and client utilities live in separate files under `components/color-rush/` and `lib/color-rush/`.

Landscape arena verification: at a 2340×1080 browser window, the active screen uses the new split layout. The target panel measures 264×586 on the left, the play area measures 733×586 on the right, and the 4×4 board is fully visible at 430×430. The target color, player name, round, HUD, feedback, and end-round action remain visible.

Portrait verification: at a mobile-sized viewport, the split breakpoint stays disabled. The target panel becomes a compact horizontal strip above the HUD and the play area remains below it, preserving the mobile vertical flow.
